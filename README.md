Data from reference monitor:
Costly reference monitor data is contained in the file named CAAQMS_MPCB. Data from 15 places around Mumbai City is included in this. This time series has an hourly sampling rate, meaning that there are 24 samples 
in total every day in this dataset. Four fundamental features are present in each data sample of this dataset: temperature, humidity, PM2.5, and PM10.

Data from low-cost sensors:
1) Respirer: This is a low-cost sensor. Data gathered from this low-cost sensor is contained in the file named respirer_hourly_data. There are just 11 locations in Mumbai city where this sensor has data.
   Both the base features and the sample rate are identical to the reference monitor.

3) Oizom: This is an additional low-cost sensor. The data gathered from this low-cost sensor is contained in the file labelled with OIZOM. There are only three locations in Mumbai city where this sensor has
   data. Both the base features and the sample rate are identical to the reference monitor.

5) Paqs: The final low-cost sensor was installed in two different parts of Mumbai. The low-cost sensor's data is contained in a file named old_paqs. Both the base features and the sample rate are identical to
   the reference monitor.
